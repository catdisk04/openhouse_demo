/demo/ page serves test1.html. It has a field for name and a hidden field hash that is filled on window.onload.

#TODO
To check if the person has already visted, hash has to posted on loading initially - make name field optional and also submit the for onload? Then serve page according to if 
post has name and if the name/md5 is already stored
